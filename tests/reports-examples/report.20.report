Skill reports:

summon imps [SUIM] 1: A mage with the Summon Imps skill may summon
  imps into his inventory, to aid him in combat. A mage may summon one
  imp per skill level; however, the imps have a chance of breaking
  free of the mage's control at the end of each turn. This chance is
  based on the number of imps in the mage's control; if the mage has
  his skill level squared times 4 imps, the chance is 5 percent; this
  chance goes up or down quickly if the mage controls more or fewer
  imps. To use this spell, the mage should issue the order CAST
  Summon_Imps, and the mage will summon as many imps as he is able. A
  unit with this skill may create imps via magic. This skill requires
  demon lore [DEMO] 1 to begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver
  per month of study.
